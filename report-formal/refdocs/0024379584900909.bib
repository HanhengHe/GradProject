abstract = {An anti-Hadamard matrix may be loosely defined as a real (0, 1) matrix which is invertible, but only just. Let A be an invertible (0, 1) matrix with eigenvalues λi, singular values σi, and inverse B = (bij). We are interested in the four closely related problems of finding λ(n) = minA, i|λi|, σ(n) = minA, i σi, χ(n) = maxA, i, j |bij|, and μ(n) = maxAΣijb2ij. Then A is an anti-Hadamard matrix if it attains μ(n). We show that λ(n), σ(n) are between (2n)−1(n4)−n2 and c√n (2.274)−n, where c is a constant, c(2.274)n⩽χ(n)⩽2(n4)n2, and c(5.172)n⩽μ(n)⩽4n2 (n4)n. We also consider these problems when A is restricted to be a Toeplitz, triangular, circulant, or (+1, −1) matrix. Besides the obvious application—to finding the most ill-conditioned (0, 1) matrices—there are connections with weighing designs, number theory, and geometry.}
