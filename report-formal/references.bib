  abstract = {Letχ1(n) denote the maximum possible absolute value of an entry of the inverse of annbyninvertible matrix with 0,1 entries. It is proved thatχ1(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This solves a problem of Graham and Sloane. Letm(n) denote the maximum possible numbermsuch that given a set ofmcoins out of a collection of coins of two unknown distinct weights, one can decide if all the coins have the same weight or not usingnweighings in a regular balance beam. It is shown thatm(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This settles a problem of Kozlov and Vũ. LetD(n) denote the maximum possible degree of a regular multi-hypergraph onnvertices that contains no proper regular nonempty subhypergraph. It is shown thatD(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This improves estimates of Shapley, van Lint and Pollak. All these results and several related ones are proved by a similar technique whose main ingredient is an extension of a construction of Håstad of threshold gates that require large weights.}

  abstract = {An anti-Hadamard matrix may be loosely defined as a real (0, 1) matrix which is invertible, but only just. Let A be an invertible (0, 1) matrix with eigenvalues λi, singular values σi, and inverse B = (bij). We are interested in the four closely related problems of finding λ(n) = minA, i|λi|, σ(n) = minA, i σi, χ(n) = maxA, i, j |bij|, and μ(n) = maxAΣijb2ij. Then A is an anti-Hadamard matrix if it attains μ(n). We show that λ(n), σ(n) are between (2n)−1(n4)−n2 and c√n (2.274)−n, where c is a constant, c(2.274)n⩽χ(n)⩽2(n4)n2, and c(5.172)n⩽μ(n)⩽4n2 (n4)n. We also consider these problems when A is restricted to be a Toeplitz, triangular, circulant, or (+1, −1) matrix. Besides the obvious application—to finding the most ill-conditioned (0, 1) matrices—there are connections with weighing designs, number theory, and geometry.}

  abstract = { The solution of the complete eigenvalue problem for a nonnormal matrix A presents severe practical difficulties when A is defective or close to a defective matrix. Moreover, in the presence of rounding errors, one cannot even determine whether or not a matrix is defective. Several of the more stable methods for computing the Jordan canonical form are discussed, together with the alternative approach of computing well-defined bases (usually orthogonal) of the relevant invariant subspaces. }
