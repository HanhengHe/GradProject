  abstract = {Letχ1(n) denote the maximum possible absolute value of an entry of the inverse of annbyninvertible matrix with 0,1 entries. It is proved thatχ1(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This solves a problem of Graham and Sloane. Letm(n) denote the maximum possible numbermsuch that given a set ofmcoins out of a collection of coins of two unknown distinct weights, one can decide if all the coins have the same weight or not usingnweighings in a regular balance beam. It is shown thatm(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This settles a problem of Kozlov and Vũ. LetD(n) denote the maximum possible degree of a regular multi-hypergraph onnvertices that contains no proper regular nonempty subhypergraph. It is shown thatD(n)=n(1/2+o(1))n. This improves estimates of Shapley, van Lint and Pollak. All these results and several related ones are proved by a similar technique whose main ingredient is an extension of a construction of Håstad of threshold gates that require large weights.}

  abstract = {An anti-Hadamard matrix may be loosely defined as a real (0, 1) matrix which is invertible, but only just. Let A be an invertible (0, 1) matrix with eigenvalues λi, singular values σi, and inverse B = (bij). We are interested in the four closely related problems of finding λ(n) = minA, i|λi|, σ(n) = minA, i σi, χ(n) = maxA, i, j |bij|, and μ(n) = maxAΣijb2ij. Then A is an anti-Hadamard matrix if it attains μ(n). We show that λ(n), σ(n) are between (2n)−1(n4)−n2 and c√n (2.274)−n, where c is a constant, c(2.274)n⩽χ(n)⩽2(n4)n2, and c(5.172)n⩽μ(n)⩽4n2 (n4)n. We also consider these problems when A is restricted to be a Toeplitz, triangular, circulant, or (+1, −1) matrix. Besides the obvious application—to finding the most ill-conditioned (0, 1) matrices—there are connections with weighing designs, number theory, and geometry.}

  abstract = { The solution of the complete eigenvalue problem for a nonnormal matrix A presents severe practical difficulties when A is defective or close to a defective matrix. Moreover, in the presence of rounding errors, one cannot even determine whether or not a matrix is defective. Several of the more stable methods for computing the Jordan canonical form are discussed, together with the alternative approach of computing well-defined bases (usually orthogonal) of the relevant invariant subspaces. }

  abstract  = {Once we have developed an algorithm (q.v.) for solving a computational problem and analyzed its worst-case time requirements as a function of the size of its input (most usefully, in terms of the O-notation; see ALGORITHMS, ANALYSIS OF), it is inevitable to ask the question: "Can we do better?" In a typical problem, we may be able to devise new algorithms for the problem that are more and more efficient. But eventually, this line of research often seems to hit an invisible barrier, a level beyond whch improvements are very difficult, seemingly impossible, to come by. After many unsuccessful attempts, algorithm designers inevitably start to wonder if there is something inherent in the problem that makes it impossible to devise algorithms that are faster than the current one. They may try to develop mathematical techniques for proving formally that there can be no algorithm for the given problem which runs faster than the current one. Such a proof would be valuable, as it would suggest that it is futile to keep working on improved algorithms for this problem, that further improvements are certainly impossible. The realm of mathematical models and techniques for establishing such impossibility proofs is called computational complexity.},
