\begin{abstract}
    This report describes the condition number of a matrix, and an equivalent quantity to the condition number when entries of the matrix are specified as $\{0, 1\}$ or $\{-1, 1\}$. Based on this, the implementation of creating an $(0, 1)$ matrix is demonstrated, and the equivalent condition number is provided, showing that such kind of $(0, 1)$ matrix becomes more ill-conditioned when its order grows. Furthermore, this report discusses the complexity of creating such a matrix, proving and showing with an experiment the exponential time complexity.

\section{Introduction}

Let matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be an invertible matrix, with the $spectral \ norm$ defined as $||A||_s = sup_{x\neq0}|Ax|/|x|$, the $condition\ number$ of $A$ is $c(A) = ||A||_s||A^{-1}||_s$. The $condition\ number$ is a measurement of the sensibility of the equation $Ax = b$ when the right-hand side is changed \cite{ALON1997133}. If $c(A)$ is large, then $A$ is called $ill-conditioned$.

With such an important property of $condition\ number$, ill-conditioned matrices are important in numerical algebra and have been studied extensively by various researchers, such as \cite{doi:10.1137/1018113}, \cite{wilkinson1972note} and \cite{neumaier1998solving}. In \cite{GRAHAM1984113}, researchers restricted entries into set $\{0, 1\}$ or $\{-1, 1\}$, denoted by $\mathcal{A}_n^1$ or $\mathcal{A}_n^2$, which they call $anti-Hadamard$ matrices and is of interest in linear algebra, combinatorics and related areas. With such restrictions, many quantities are equivalent to the condition number. Let $A$ be a non-singular $(0, 1)$ matrix, $B = A^{-1} = (b_{ij})$, the following quantity as an equivalent condition number is considered in \cite{GRAHAM1984113}:
\begin{align*}
\chi(A) = max_{i, j}|b_{ij}|\ and\ \chi(n) = max_A \chi(A).
\end{align*}
Shown in \cite{GRAHAM1984113}, we have $c(2.274)^n \leq \chi(n) \leq 2(n/4)^{n/2}$ for some absolute positive constant $c$, which means $\chi(A)$ is bounded controlled by $n$ and $c$. Meanwhile, since matrix $A$ is a square matrix and only contains $0$ and $1$, it also stands for a 0/1-polytope space, which is of great interest in geometry.

In this report, we aim to construct an ill-conditioned $(0, 1)$ matrix $C$ satisfied
\begin{align*}
\chi(C) \geq2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(2+o(1))}.
\end{align*}
Hence, matrix $C$ has a controlled infimum of its $condition\ number$ concerning $n$. 

Following the steps in \cite{ALON1997133}, we started by generating matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$, and we generate $B \in \mathcal{A}_n^1$ based on $A$. Using a series of matrix $B$ with different shapes, we can further concatenate a $(0, 1)$ matrix $C$ with its controlled infimum of condition number.

\section{Generate Ill-conditioned Matrix $C$}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   2.1 Generate Set $\Omega$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Generate Set $\Omega$}
To start constructing matrix $C$ with a controlled infimum of $condition\ number$, a set $\Omega$ with special restrictions is required. Let $|\cdot|$ denote cardinality and $\Delta$ denote symmetric different, let $m\in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, $n=2^m$. Set $\Omega = \{\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n\}$ with $n + 1$ elements is required to create with restrictions that $|\alpha_i| \leq |\alpha_{i+1}|$ and $|\alpha_i \Delta \alpha_{i+1}| \leq 2$. Shown in \cite{doi:10.1137/S0895480192235878}, $\Omega$ is proved to exist, and we further discuss the implementational way to create such kind of set. The following description shows an implemented way.

Let $\alpha_0=\{\varnothing\}$. We also have $\alpha_1=\{\varnothing\}$. Suppose we have $\Omega = \{\{\varnothing\}, \{\varnothing\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, ..., \{m\}\}$ initially. Considering that every time we only take out all the sets of maximum size in $\Omega$, and insert only one element inside in order. For example, for an existing set $\{1\}$, we insert elements one by one $2, 3, ..., m$ in order, and get a series of sets $\{1, 2\}, \{1, 3\}, ..., \{1, m\}$.

With such way of insertion, we only need to consider if the conditions are satisfied between the last old set and the first new set, and if the continuous new sets come from different old sets. For all the sets that come from the same old set, the conditions are satisfied automatically.
\begin{lstlisting}
Initially Omega = {{}, {}, {1}, {2}, ..., {m}}, insert only one element each time on {1}, {2}, ..., {m} in order. Make sure conditions are satisfied between:
    1. {m} and {1, _}; 
    2. {1, _} and {2, _}, {2, _} and {3, _}, ...
\end{lstlisting}

For the first case above, the only element we can insert to $\{1, \_\}$ is $m$, which is the first element if we revert the ordered insertion $2, 3, ..., m$. For the second case, let's say we have set $\alpha$ with size $k$ and $\beta$ with size $k-1$, if $\alpha \cup \beta = \alpha$, we can insert any element; if $\alpha \cup \beta \neq \alpha$, we can only insert an element $r \in \alpha$. Since we always insert elements in order or reversed order, if the first element of the insertion list is not in $\alpha$, the last element of the insertion list or the first of the reverted list must be in $\alpha$.

The following pseudo-code shows the way to generate $\Omega$: 

\begin{algorithm}[H] 
    \caption{Generate $\Omega$}
    \label{alg:loop}
    \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Require{$m$} 
    \Ensure{$\Omega$}
      \State {$\Omega$ $\gets$ $\{\{\}, \{\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, ..., \{m\}\}$}
        \For{$i \gets 1$ to $m-1$}          
            \State {$\Phi$ $\gets$ $sets\ in\ \Omega\ with\ size\ equals\ i$}          
            \For{$\phi$ in $\Phi$}     
                \State {$\alpha$ $\gets$ [max($\phi$) + 1, ..., m]}
                \If{$\alpha$ not in $\Omega$[-1]}:
                    \State {$\alpha$ $\gets$ $\alpha$.reverse()}
                \EndIf
                \For{$a$ in $\alpha$}     
                    \State {$\Omega$ $\gets$ \{$\Omega$.., \{$\phi$.., $a$\}\}} \Comment{$\phi..$ means extend set $\phi$}
                \EndFor
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
        \State \Return {$\Omega$}
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

when $m=4$, set $\Omega$ is shown below:
\begin{lstlisting}
Omega = {{}, {}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, 
        {1, 4}, {1, 3}, {1, 2}, {2, 4}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, 
        {1, 3, 4}, {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, {2, 3, 4}, 
        {1, 2, 3, 4}}
\end{lstlisting}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%   2.2 Generate Matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Construct Matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ with Set $\Omega$}
Shown in \cite{ALON1997133}, with set $\Omega = \{\alpha_0, \alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n\}$ satisfies $|\alpha_i| \leq |\alpha_{i+1}|$ and $|\alpha_i \Delta \alpha_{i+1}| \leq 2$, matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ can be constructed as follows such that $\chi(A)=2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(1+o(1))}$:\\
For every $1 \leq i,j \leq n$:
\begin{align*}
    a_{ij} = 
    \begin{cases}
    -1,\;\alpha_j\cap(\alpha_{i-1}\cup\alpha_i)=\alpha_{i-1}\Delta\alpha_{i}\;and\;|\alpha_{i-1}\Delta\alpha_{i}|=2 \\
    (-1)^{|\alpha_{i-1}\cap\alpha_j| + 1},\;\alpha_{j}\cap(\alpha_{i-1}\cup\alpha_{i})\neq\varnothing\;but\;does\;not\;meet\;the\;condition\;above \\
    1,\;\alpha_j\cap(\alpha_{i-1}\cup\alpha_i)=\varnothing \\
    \end{cases}.
\end{align*}

With the $\Omega$ constructed shown in section 2.1, matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ is shown below:

$$A = 
\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\

\end{smallmatrix}\right].
$$

In \cite{ALON1997133}, researchers further discussed some properties of the $\{-1, 1\}$ matrix. Let symmetric Hadamard matrix $Q$ be an $n$ by $n$ matrix given by $q_{ij} = (-1)^{|\alpha_i\cap\alpha_j|}$, that is $Q^2 = nI_n$. There existed a lower triangular matrix $L$ built by $\Omega$ satisfying $A=LQ$. In this report, we show $L = AQ^{-1}$ is a lower triangular matrix.

With matrix $A$ shown above, matrix $Q$ and $L$ is shown below:
$$Q=
\left[\begin{smallmatrix}

%   2.3 Generate Matrix $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Mapping Matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ to $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$}
With matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ being constructed, a mapping can be implemented to generate a matrix $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n-1}^{1}$ such that $\chi(B)=2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(1+o(1))}$. Consider the map $\Phi$ which assigns to any matrix $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$ a matrix $\Phi(B) \in \mathcal{A}_{n}^2$ in the following way:
$$ \Phi(B) = \left(\begin{array}{cc} 
1 & 1_{n-1}\\
-1^T_{n-1} & 2B-J_{n-1}
\end{array}\right).
$$

Clearly $\Phi(B)$ is a mapping $\mathcal{A}_n^2 \to \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$ with a series of linear operations, so we have the following reversing way to construct matrix $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$ with $A=\{a_{ij}\}\in \mathcal{A}_n^2$:

$$B = \frac{1}{2}(J_{n-1}+\{a_{ij}\}_{2\le i\le n, 2\le j\le n}).$$

Notice that in the above section, the $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ we constructed has it's first column as
$$ \left(\begin{array}{cc} 
1\\
1^T_{n-1}
\end{array}\right).
$$
Therefore,  we need to negative the first column. The relation between matrix $B \in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$ and $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ is shown as follows:    
$$B = \frac{1}{2}(J_{n-1}-\{a_{ij}\}_{2\le i\le n, 2\le j\le n}).$$

With the matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ constructed above, the corresponding matrix $B$ is shown below:

$$B=
\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
    1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
    0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\

\end{smallmatrix}\right].

Shown in \cite{ALON1997133}, matrix $B$ preserves the property of its condition number, that is $\chi(B)=2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(1+o(1))}$.

\subsection{Generate and Verify Ill-conditioned Matrix $C$}
Before constructing matrix $C$, \cite{ALON1997133} shows a way of concatenating that has a special property. Let $S$ and $T$ be two non-singular matrices of order $n_1$ and $n_2$. Define $S \diamond T$ as follows:
$$R=
\left[\begin{smallmatrix}
    s_{11} & \dots & s_{1n_1} & 0 & \dots  & 0 \\
    s_{21} & \dots & s_{2n_1} & 0 & \dots  & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    s_{n_11} & \dots & s_{n_1n_1} & 0 & \dots  & 0 \\
    0 & 0 \dots 0 & 1 & t_{11} & \dots & t_{1n_2} \\
    0 & 0 \dots 0 & 0 & t_{21} & \dots & t_{2n_2} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 \dots 0 & 0 & t_{n_21} & \dots & t_{n_2n_2} \\
\end{smallmatrix}\right].
$$

It's shown that $R$ has the following property:

\begin{align*}
\chi(S \diamond T) \geq \chi(S)\chi(S),
\end{align*}

which shows an infimum of the condition number when constructing of the ill-conditioned $C$. Consider a $(0, 1)$ matrix $C = A_1 \diamond (A_2 \diamond (. . . (A_{r-1} \diamond A_r))...)$ with order $\sum_{i=1}^rn_i=n$. With the definition of the operator $\diamond$, we have the following conclusion that
$$\chi(C)\geq \prod_{i=1}^r\chi(A_i) > 2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(2+o(1))}.$$
This conclusion describes the infimum of $\chi(C)$, and it is evidently that matrix $C$ is ill-conditioned concerning $n$.

Since the concatenation rapidly enlarges the order of the matrix, we can not show the matrix $C$ constructed with all the steps described in previous sections. Instead, we show the result of $\chi(C)$ with different values of $n$. Remind that $C = A_1 \diamond (A_2 \diamond (. . . (A_{r-1} \diamond A_r))...)$, where $r$ is the largest order of all the $(0, 1)$ matrices $A$:

\begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
r = 2, order of C = 4, (*$\chi$*)(C) = 1.0
r = 3, order of C = 11, (*$\chi$*)(C) = 2.0
r = 4, order of C = 26, (*$\chi$*)(C) = 260.0
r = 5, order of C = 57, (*$\chi$*)(C) = 106491641548.6
\end{lstlisting}

With the result above, we can observe that as order $r$ grows, $\chi(C)$ grows rapidly, and may go to infinity.

\section{Complexity Analysis of Generating Matrix $C$}
\subsection{Time Complexity of Creating $\Omega$}
With a well-defined task of creating the matrix $C$, a further discussion can be approached with its final goal of proofing the limit of an algorithm. The field of mathematical models and techniques for demonstrating such proofs is named computational complexity \cite{10.5555/1074100.1074233}. Since the computational complexity of a sequence is to be measured by how fast a multitap Turing machine can work out on the sequence \cite{hartmanis1965computational}, many researchers have studied computational complexity for a long time, such as \cite{papadimitriou2003computational}, \cite{du2011theory} and \cite{cook2007overview}.

In this section, we discuss the complexity of constructing matrix $C$ and further show the reason for not being able to generate matrix $C$ with large $r$. Since we go through all these steps with code on a modern machine, we assume that we have enough memory and focus on the time complexity.

To generate set $\Omega$, every time we only need to take out one generated set and insert one new element inside. The insertion operation is $O(\log n)$, but notice that we always insert an element larger than the maximum of a set, we can consider it an $O(1)$, without considering the maintenance of the internal tree data structure. Therefore, the most ideal time complexity is $O(n)$, which cannot be reached but is still used.

A more detailed complexity analysis is shown below. In the implementation, there are 2 for-loop with $O(m)$ and at least $O(m)$ time complexity. With all the assignments, set insertion, set reversion operation, and an extra for-loop neglected, a rough time complexity estimation would be $O(m^2)$.

\begin{algorithm}[H] 
    \caption{Time Complexity of Generating $\Omega$}

                \State {$\alpha$ $\gets$ [max($\phi$) + 1, ..., m]} \Comment{the max(...) of an ordered set is $O(1)$}
                \If{$\alpha$ not in $\Omega$[-1]}:
                    \State {$\alpha$ $\gets$ $\alpha$.reverse()} \Comment{a set reversion operation}
                \EndIf
                \For{$a$ in $\alpha$} \Comment{$m - $max$(\phi) - 1$, more than $O(1)$}
                    \State {$\Omega$ $\gets$ \{$\Omega$..., \{$\phi$..., $a$\}\}} \Comment{a set insertion operation}
                \EndFor
            \EndFor
        \EndFor
        \State \Return {$\Omega$}
    \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Time Complexity of Creating $(0, 1)$ Matrix $C$}
To generate every entry of matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$, visits of all elements in $A$ are necessary. Let $m$ stand for the size of set  $\Omega$, $n=2^m$ be the order of matrix $A$, without considering the complexity of set indexing, the union operation, and the intersection operation needed in every single calculation, the ideal time complexity of construct a matrix $A \in \mathcal{A}_n^2$ is at least $O(m) + O(2^{2m}) = O(2^m)$.

Generating matrix $B\in \mathcal{A}_{n - 1}^1$ required simple matrix operation. Let $n - 1$ be the order of $B$, the time complexity of this part is $O((n-1)^2) = O(n^2) = O(2^m)$.

To splice out matrix $C$, we need a series of matrix $A_1$, $A_2$, ... , $A_n$ with orders $2^1-1, 2^2-1, ..., 2^m-1$. With matrix $A_r$ with order $r$ having $O(r^2)$ time complexity, to create all these matrices, we can estimate a sum up, that is $\sum_{i=1}^{m}O((2^m - 1)^2) = O(m2^{2m}) = O(m2^m) = O(2^m)$. An extra time complexity of matrix assignment is also needed, which is ($\sum_{i=0}^{m}O(2^m - 1))^2 = O(m^22^{2m})$ or $O(2^m)$

Remind that we only consider parts of the essential operation, most of the internal operations including indexing, union, intersection, and more. Therefore, to create the $(0, 1)$ Matrix $C$, we need an exponential time complexity; when $m$ grows, the time required to generate matrix $C$ grows exponentially.

The following figure \ref{costoftime} shows the relation between the time of generating matrix $C$ and size controller $m$. An exponential growth is shown as expected.

\section{Conclusion}
This report shows the $(0, 1)$ matrix $C$ created with specific steps to ensure its equivalent condition number $\chi(C) > 2^{\frac{1}{2}n\log n-n(2+o(1))}$ is ill-conditioned as it's order grows. Also, we prove the exponential time complexity of creating such a matrix, showing that it is expensive to create when the order of $C$ grows.
